K-Way Merge

- Solve problems involving list of sorted arrays

KEY: Use the HEAP as a median between the dispersed list and the merged list

Many sorted lists -> heap -> merged list

Pattern:

1. Insert first element of each array in a min heap
2. Remove smallest element and add to merged array
3. From the array the smallest element came from, add the next element into the heap
(Requires keeping track of which array each element comes from in the min-heap)

Keep doing until the heap is empty

Could you also just add all elements into a heap?
